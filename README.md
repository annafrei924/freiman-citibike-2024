# Conway's Game of Life Project

This project uses an interactive GUI to mimic Conway's Game of Life. It also feaures an RLE translator, so if the user hits the "Paste" button, it reads the clipboard and translates
1. The text of an RLE file 
2. The URL of a file online that contains the RLE
3. The location of the file on one's computer

into a grid which is loaded into the field.

The "Play" button plays the next generation every second, showing which cells are alive and which aren't. The "Pause" button pauses the game, and the "Clear" button restarts it.
